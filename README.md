## üèõÔ∏è Technical Architecture

This project utilizes a robust, decoupled architecture with a Django backend serving a RESTful API and managing real-time WebSocket connections, and a separate React single-page application for the user interface.

## üß† Challenges & Solutions

This section highlights key technical challenges encountered during development and the strategies used to overcome them.

### 1. Synchronizing 3D Interaction with Game Logic

*   **The Challenge:** Translating a user's click on the 3D canvas into a valid chess move. This required mapping a 2D screen coordinate to a 3D object (a board square) and then correlating that to the abstract game state managed by `chess.js`.

*   **The Solution:**
    1.  **Raycasting:** I used Three.js's `Raycaster` to project a ray from the camera through the mouse's 2D coordinates into the 3D scene.
    2.  **Object Identification:** Each square on the board was a distinct mesh object with a unique name (e.g., "e4", "h8"). The raycaster would return a list of intersected objects.
    3.  **State Reconciliation:** The name of the intersected square was then used to update the React component's state (e.g., `fromSquare`, `toSquare`). This state change would then trigger a call to the `chess.js` instance to validate and attempt the move. This decoupled the rendering logic from the game rules, creating a clean separation of concerns.

### 2. Ensuring Real-Time Game State Consistency

*   **The Challenge:** In a multiplayer game, ensuring that both players' boards are perfectly synchronized and that moves are processed in the correct order without race conditions.

*   **The Solution:**
    1.  **Authoritative Server:** The backend server acts as the single source of truth for the game state. The `chess.js` instance lives on the server, and clients only send *move intents* (e.g., "move from e2 to e4").
    2.  **Event-Based Communication:** Socket.IO was used to manage game rooms. When a player makes a move:
        *   The client emits a `move` event to the server.
        *   The server validates the move with `chess.js`.
        *   If valid, the server updates its internal game state and then **broadcasts** an `updateState` event to *all clients* in that game room with the new board position (in FEN format) and game status.
    3.  **State Hydration:** Client-side, the React application listens for the `updateState` event and uses the received FEN string to re-render the board. This ensures that clients are always displaying the state as dictated by the server, preventing desynchronization.
